# flutter_examples

A new Flutter application, To demonstrate different things in Flutter.

## Examples:

## 1. Parse Array without key from API.
In this Example I have used Open Source API to fetch data: 
**API :** https://www.mercadobitcoin.net/api-doc/

**Response :**
```json

    [
      {
        "tid": 160171,
        "date": 1554591168,
        "type": "buy",
        "price": 1.40988,
        "amount": 0.99299231
      },
      {
        "tid": 160172,
        "date": 1554591205,
        "type": "buy",
        "price": 1.40988,
        "amount": 72.21
      }
    ]

```

Add dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file.
